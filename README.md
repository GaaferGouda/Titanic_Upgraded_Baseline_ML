# Titanic – Upgraded Baseline Machine Learning Model

## Description
This project builds an upgraded baseline **machine learning model** to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. 

It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to improve accuracy over the basic baseline. 
The focus is on making simple yet effective predictions using structured data features such as age, gender, class, and fare.
